1. Ensure tests pass before creating the pull request.

2. Please use a coding style similar to the rest of the file(s) you change. This isn't a hard rule but if it's too different, it will stick out.

3. We have a contributor license agreement (CLA) based off of Google and Apache's CLA. If you would feel comfortable contributing to, say, Angular.js, you should feel comfortable with this CLA.
